# ### **In this project we are going to explore the stats of Olympic games' athletes. A dataset is provided which includes the atheletes names along with their weights, heights, ages and nationalities. Their corresponding athletic field with their medal has been provided as well.**

# # Importing the necessary packages

import numpy as np
